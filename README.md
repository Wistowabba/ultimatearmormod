##Minecraft - Ultimate Armor Mod

Based, in part, on [Bacon Mod](https://github.com/pvanhouten/thatconference-baconmod).

This mod provides a collection of armor [and associated craft items] to the game, and 
is a work in progress.  The modification is currently built for Minecraft 1.7.10, and
requires Forge version 1.7.10 to work properly.

###Current State:

This modification is a learning tool for both programming and the Minecraft
modification process, and as such is extremely limited at the current time.  We
hope to implement multiple, craftable, full-armor sets as the mod advances, and
we encourage people to fork the repository and see what great stuff you can create!
